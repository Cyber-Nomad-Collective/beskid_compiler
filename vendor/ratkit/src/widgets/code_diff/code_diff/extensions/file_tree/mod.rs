//! Diff file tree widget for displaying changed files.
//!
//! A tree view widget for displaying changed files in a diff, similar to
//! gitui's unstaged changes panel or VS Code's source control view.
//!
//! This implementation wraps the generic TreeView component for simplified code.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **Hierarchical display**: Groups files by directory structure
//! - **Status markers**: Visual indicators for file status (M, +, -, R)
//! - **Collapsible directories**: Expand/collapse with keyboard
//! - **Color coding**: Green (added), yellow (modified), red (deleted), blue (renamed)
//! - **Keyboard navigation**: Uses TreeView's navigation
//!
//! # Structure
//!
//! - [`DiffFileTree`] - The main tree widget (wraps TreeView)
//! - [`DiffFileEntry`] - Data type for tree nodes (path + status)
//! - [`FileStatus`] - File modification status enum
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use ratatui_toolkit::widgets::code_diff::diff_file_tree::{DiffFileTree, FileStatus};
//!
//! let files = vec![
//!     ("src/lib.rs", FileStatus::Modified),
//!     ("src/utils/helper.rs", FileStatus::Added),
//!     ("src/old_module.rs", FileStatus::Deleted),
//! ];
//!
//! let tree = DiffFileTree::from_paths(&files);
//!
//! // Render with ratatui Widget trait...
//! // frame.render_widget(&tree, area);
//! ```
//!
//! # Visual Style
//!
//! ```text
//! M  src/
//!      lib.rs
//! +    utils/
//! +      helper.rs
//! -    old_module.rs
//! ```
