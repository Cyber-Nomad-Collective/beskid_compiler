///
/// fn handle_widget_event(event: WidgetEvent) {

///         WidgetEvent::None => {}
///         WidgetEvent::Selected { path } => println!("Selected: {:?}", path),
///         WidgetEvent::Toggled { path, expanded } => println!("Toggled: {:?} = {}", path, expanded),
///         WidgetEvent::Scrolled { offset, direction } => println!("Scrolled to {}", offset),
///         WidgetEvent::FilterModeChanged { active, filter } => {
///             println!("Filter {}: {}", if active { "on" } else { "off" }, filter);
///         }
///         WidgetEvent::FilterModeExited { path } => println!("Filter exited, focus: {:?}", path),
///         WidgetEvent::MenuSelected { index, action: _ } => println!("Menu item {} selected", index),
