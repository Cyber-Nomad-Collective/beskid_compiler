/// Implement this trait to provide a standardized way for widgets
/// to declare what hotkeys they support and in what scope they are active.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use ratatui_toolkit::services::hotkey::{Hotkey, HotkeyScope, HasHotkeys};
///
/// struct MyWidget;
///
/// impl HasHotkeys for MyWidget {
///     fn hotkeys(&self) -> Vec<Hotkey> {
///         vec![
///             Hotkey::new("j", "Move down").scope(HotkeyScope::Global),
///             Hotkey::new("k", "Move up").scope(HotkeyScope::Global),
///         ]
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `scope` - The scope to filter by
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Hotkeys that are active in the given scope.
