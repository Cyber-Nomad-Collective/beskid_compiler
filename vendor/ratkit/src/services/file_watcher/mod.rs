//! File watching service for detecting file system changes.
//!
//! A reusable, configurable file watcher that can be used across multiple
//! components in the toolkit. Supports watching single files or entire
//! directory trees.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use crate::services::file_watcher::{FileWatcher, WatchMode};
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! // Watch a single file
//! let mut watcher = FileWatcher::for_file().unwrap();
//! watcher.watch(Path::new("README.md")).unwrap();
//!
//! // In your event loop:
//! if watcher.check_for_changes() {
//!     println!("File changed!");
//! }
//!
//! // Watch a directory recursively
//! let mut dir_watcher = FileWatcher::for_directory().unwrap();
//! dir_watcher.watch(Path::new("./src")).unwrap();
//!
//! // Get which paths changed
//! let changed = dir_watcher.get_changed_paths();
//! for path in changed {
//!     println!("Changed: {}", path.display());
//! }
//! ```
