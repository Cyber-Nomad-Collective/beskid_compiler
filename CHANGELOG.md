# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) when applicable.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Reject HIR/`Lowerable` codegen drivers (`lower_source*`, `lower_from_front_end`,
  `lower_program*`) with an explicit retired-path error so production assemblies must use
  `CodegenInput` plus `lower_syntax_*` / `lower_prepared_syntax_*`; multi-unit parsed-project
  harnesses prove stock-verifier-clean ISLE emission without a legacy fallback.
- Extend generation-safe `ClosureCapture` facts with capture mode (`CaptureStorageClass`) and
  first use-site span so `closure_environment` / spawn capture sets cover nested closures and
  shadowing without legacy analysis snapshots (CYB-96 / CYB-16).

### Added
- Cover multi-function syntax assembly failures at the module boundary, including deterministic
  attribution to the failing function rather than a sibling item.
- Catalogue every expanded-syntax node kind at the generated ISLE boundary with an exhaustive,
  deterministic lowered, structural, or unsupported-operation classification.
- Lower Corelib soft string builtins (`__str_len`, `__str_slice`, …), string concat/eq from
  interpolation desugar, and `string[index]` byte reads through syntax ISLE dispatch rules, so
  Foundation `Testing/Assert.bd` and `Core/String/String.bd` no longer fail with
  `MissingRuleOrFact` on the syntax-only path.
- Add opt-in `BESKID_COMPILER_TRACE=1` syntax-ISLE records for source keys, AST spans,
  call/import facts, selection failures, and CLIF emission timing in Corelib CI diagnostics.
- Authorize only the compiler-owned Foundation `Testing/Assert.bd` identity to lower
  `__panic_str` as the `panic_str` Corelib service; copied source remains ordinary syntax and
  emission declares only services reached by authorized calls.
- Lower compiler-authorized Corelib syscall services through distinct ABI imports in syntax ISLE
  codegen, without granting ordinary applications or canonical runtime intrinsic authority.
- Add a compiler-minted Corelib syscall service capability and syntax lowering fact that only
  accepts the exact embedded `Core/Syscall/Syscall.bd` corpus.
- Add generation-safe enum-constructor facts and syntax-only ISLE lowering for nullary and
  single-payload variants.
- Add canonical Beskid allocation-header ownership and LIFO root-frame primitives as the
  bounded input to a future non-moving collector.
- Add a manifest-derived ABI-v5 runtime provenance audit and portable explicit-symbol-list verifier.
- Add canonical-runtime `pointer`, `word`, and `never` source signatures plus compiler-minted intrinsic-call authority.
- Categorize every HIR retirement blocker without allowlists and verify all ABI-v5 provenance fixtures from the release gate.
- Inspect Cargo manifests for retired Rust runtime, bridge, and host dependency paths in the ABI-v5 retirement gate.
- Add an explicit native-runtime-kit CI migration diagnostic and fixture test that identifies every remaining runtime-bridge setup caller.
- Add the Apple Silicon native platform-shim artifact for ABI-v5 allocation, release, and trap,
  with manifest-platform import provenance checks and no Rust bridge dependency.
- Add a native-host runtime-kit CLI publisher and CI staging wrapper for exact debug or release
  host artifacts.

### Changed
- Reject HIR/`Lowerable` codegen drivers (`lower_source*`, `lower_from_front_end`,
  `lower_program*`) with an explicit retired-path error so production assemblies must use
  `CodegenInput` plus `lower_syntax_*` / `lower_prepared_syntax_*`; multi-unit parsed-project
  harnesses prove stock-verifier-clean ISLE emission without a legacy fallback.
- Extend generation-safe `ClosureCapture` facts with capture mode (`CaptureStorageClass`) and
  first use-site span so `closure_environment` / spawn capture sets cover nested closures and
  shadowing without legacy analysis snapshots (CYB-96 / CYB-16).

### Fixed
- Preserve each generated-ISLE verification failure's originating expanded-syntax key and render
  its deterministic source path, generation/node identity, construct, and range through module
  diagnostics.
- Refuse a fixed `item_abi_signature` for generic function declarations so module emission
  registers call-derived `SpecializedItem` identities (including zero-argument factories whose
  nominal return type collapses to POINTER).
- Keep direct call lowering for nested generic calls that forward an enclosing type parameter
  (`CreateWithOptions<T>` inside `Create<T>`), so reachability and specialization collection stay
  connected for Corelib Channel/Console factories.
- Classify generic syntax module items before selecting ABI specializations, omitting generic
  type and enum declarations that have source layout facts but no executable ISLE body.
- Require an exact compiler-owned lexical source path before granting Foundation panic-service
  authority, so symlinked `Testing/Assert.bd` sources remain ordinary syntax.
- Follow parsed public module declarations in import-closure assembly while keeping use-path
  completion candidates scoped to the next unqualified module segment.
- Preserve complete logical module names for assembled `.generated/*.g.bd` units so syntax
  consumers do not register `Generated` modules under a truncated name.
- Terminate reachable syntax-ISLE control-flow merge blocks after one-arm `if` statements and
  preserve valid unreachable merges when both arms return.

### Removed
- Remove the public runtime-kit-bypassing `emit_library_pair` AOT API. Native runtime publication
  now enters only through the host context/platform emitters used by the canonical runtime-kit
  builder.
- Remove the obsolete Rust language-handler regeneration hook, which targeted the retired
  runtime.v1 manifest rather than the canonical ABI-v5 contract.
- Remove the borrowed `FrontEndLowerInput` / HIR-only entrypoint codegen boundary.
- Remove AOT prebuilt-archive and standalone fallbacks, runtime link profiles, and host-archive lookup.
- Remove legacy Rust runtime registration, Engine-owned Rust runtime state, scheduler/TLS wrappers, and JIT `std`/`minimal` profile selection.
