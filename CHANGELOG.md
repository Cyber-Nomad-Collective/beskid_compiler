## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add canonical Beskid allocation-header ownership and LIFO root-frame primitives as the
  bounded input to a future non-moving collector.
- Add a manifest-derived ABI-v5 runtime provenance audit and portable explicit-symbol-list verifier.
- Add canonical-runtime `pointer`, `word`, and `never` source signatures plus compiler-minted intrinsic-call authority.
- Categorize every HIR retirement blocker without allowlists and verify all ABI-v5 provenance fixtures from the release gate.
- Add an explicit native-runtime-kit CI migration diagnostic and fixture test that identifies every remaining runtime-bridge setup caller.
- Add the Apple Silicon native platform-shim artifact for ABI-v5 allocation, release, and trap,
  with manifest-platform import provenance checks and no Rust bridge dependency.
- Add a native-host runtime-kit CLI publisher and CI staging wrapper for exact debug or release
  host artifacts.

### Changed

- Audit Linux shared ABI-v5 runtime artifacts with an exact ELF loader-import allowlist while
  preserving the static archive and Rust-runtime linkage boundary.
- Centralize post-mod-rewrite syntax assembly projection at the shared frontend boundary for
  Engine and prepared syntax lowering.
- Serve LSP completion from generation-bound syntax/Salsa facts with exact replacement edits, including imported module members.
- Make the exact installed ABI-v5 runtime kit the sole Engine, JIT, REPL, and in-process test runtime authority.
- Require linked AOT artifacts to use one hash-validated ABI-v5 runtime kit while retaining runtime-free object emission.
- Derive lambda capture environments, spawn operands, and manifest-owned runtime intrinsics from expanded AST/Salsa facts.
- Add a generation-safe expanded-syntax to generated-ISLE adapter for production expression emission.
- Emit zero-parameter parsed function bodies through syntax-only generated ISLE statement rules.
- Route prepared frontend Engine and fixture entrypoints through generation-safe syntax,
  `TypedProgram`, `CodegenInput`, and ISLE module emission rather than typed HIR.
- Lower compiler-authorized canonical runtime intrinsic calls through syntax-only ISLE module
  emission, with manifest-derived imports and verified CLIF coverage for allocation and root-frame
  helpers.
- Derive contextual primitive cast intents from direct and canonical ABI-v5 intrinsic call
  parameters so runtime `word` offsets are typed before ISLE emission.

### Removed

- Remove the borrowed `FrontEndLowerInput` / HIR-only entrypoint codegen boundary.

- Remove AOT prebuilt-archive and standalone fallbacks, runtime link profiles, and host-archive lookup.

- Remove legacy Rust runtime registration, Engine-owned Rust runtime state, scheduler/TLS wrappers, and JIT `std`/`minimal` profile selection.
